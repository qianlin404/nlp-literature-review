This is a literature review project for CS685 - advanced topics in Natural Langauge Processing - course.

### Abstract

Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as the explosive growth of text data have allowed researchers to build state-of-the-art methods to solve a wide variety of natural language tasks, such as text classification, part-of-speech tagging and semantics parsing. In this survey, we describe how these methods can be used to build powerful tools to solve problems in various fields, including politics, medicine, education and finance. We will organize and give an overview of researches in applications of NLP, which encompass exciting research and practical challenges as well as promising business opportunities.
